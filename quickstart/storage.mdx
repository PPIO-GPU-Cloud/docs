- Cloud storage is an expandable storage solution available in the cloud, allowing users to increase the size of their cloud drives at any time to augment storage capacity without losing pre-existing data on the drives.

## Creating Cloud Storage
1. Click on "Create Cloud Storage".
2. Select the cluster where the cloud storage will reside. The storage cluster is tightly bound to your instance and currently does not support cross-cluster mounting of cloud storage to instances.
3. Enter the name and capacity of the storage partition, and click "Confirm" after verifying the details are correct.



## Expanding Cloud Storage

You can expand your cloud storage through the console as follows: 
1. On the "Storage Management" page, click on the upper right corner of the cloud storage you wish to expand. 
2. Click "Edit" to modify the cloud storage configuration.

**Note: The platform only supports expansion; the storage capacity cannot be less than the size before modification.** 



## Deleting Cloud Storage

You can delete your cloud storage through the console as follows:
1. On the "Storage Management" page, click on the upper right corner of the cloud storage you wish to delete.
2. Click "Delete".

**Note: Deletion is irreversible. Once deleted, all your data will be lost. Please proceed with caution.**
