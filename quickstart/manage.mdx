## Stop an Instance
1. Log in to the instance management page.
2. In the instance list, find the instance you need to shut down.
3. Click the "Shut Down" button on the right side of the instance entry.
4. Select the "Shut Down" option and follow the prompts to confirm the action.

Before proceeding with the shutdown operation, please ensure all work progress is saved to avoid data loss.
The system and data disks of the instance are both local disks. Local data disks offer superior performance but lack redundant copies and are subject to the inherent lifespan limitations of local storage, potentially leading to failures. It is advisable to regularly back up important data to the cloud or locally, as Infrai does not provide reliability commitments or services for such local storage products.
Data retention rule in instances: Data remains as long as the instance exists. Even if the instance is shut down, local storage will still incur charges unless the instance is released; there is a release cycle for instances, with the rule being that instances are released after being shut down continuously for 7 days, at which point all data in the instance will be erased.
