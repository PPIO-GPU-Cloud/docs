## Jupyter

Jupyter is an interactive notebook interface, exceptionally well-suited for AI/ML development using Python. By utilizing Jupyter, you can connect to the interface through a browser, and open any notebook that can be downloaded as a .ipynb file.

## Feature Introduction



### Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source interactive computing environment, allowing users to create and share documents containing live code, text, mathematical equations, visualizations, and explanatory content in a browser. It supports various programming languages such as Python, R, Julia, Scala, etc., and is widely used in data science, machine learning, education, and research fields. Within the Notebook, you can execute code blocks, view output results, and save the entire workflow.

You can create new interactive environments in the JupyterLab workspace.

### Terminal

The Terminal, integrated within the JupyterLab environment, is a terminal emulator that allows users to access the command line directly, executing system commands and scripts. This means you can engage in data analysis, code writing, run Jupyter Notebooks, and manage files or install software all within the same interface.

By using JupyterLab's Terminal, you can:

1. Execute operating system commands, such as file operations and package management.
2. Run shell scripts or batch files.
3. Interact with the JupyterLab environment, such as installing JupyterLab extensions or kernels.
4. Manage the JupyterLab server, such as starting, stopping, or restarting services.

To open a Terminal in JupyterLab, typically, you would click on "File" -> "New Launcher" in the menu bar, then select "Terminal" in the pop-up window to create a new terminal. Alternatively, you can also open a new terminal quickly with a shortcut key (usually `Ctrl+Shift+T`).
