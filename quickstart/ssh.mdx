## Quick Start
### Logging in via SSH Key (Recommended)
#### Linux/MacOS 
1. On Ubuntu or Mac, use the following command to generate an RSA SSH public/private key pair:


```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
``` 

2. Force the agent to load the new private key and verify it's loaded:


```bash
ssh-add; ssh-add -l
``` 

3. Retrieve the content of the public key:


```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
``` 


4. Copy the output to the "SSH Public Key" textbox under [Personal Center]() . Ensure it includes "ssh-rsa" and "user@something".

Example of an SSH Key:


```bash
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDopiaR1Q6Na6dW1QTK7hMuHVi+gXqutY5pUvrWCgeyjcBtBLHejxDQjdNt+qWQRORK/fZzrmyA8/ghani0rZlGPN3bYw1RXFHitt+bD1jVgtJzOmjMQdpMVALnZASQMoQQcCqVJ8PG5Xc08TciACS7S/Ltz3VdZfIq1tih969GCzCe3sctSFBuTwqUDnyrQ6iqSBhPSfQS7nCC/CwzMi3rDg0JzW2NHzIBsbvy0gdXy1ZtC4kkCr7/lUWAgZLk52v3s2CTXCg6QXnhWx+Q/dHOJVAEEucY4o8bo4rF4Bj+ifgEHFtUEfoK9+yj3OLbWfpIxyzhHK+nNXz3UaOMSC8D ultra@ppio
```


#### Windows

Windows requires additional command-line tools like Cmder to generate SSH keys, with operations consistent with Linux.

Since most machine learning and AI programming is performed on Linux, we strongly recommend installing a Linux subsystem on your Windows machine, such as WSL.
## Common Issues

If you encounter a "Permission denied(publickey)" error, it might be due to:
- Attempting to run SSH/SCP from within an instance
- Incorrect key setup or using the wrong/unmatched key
- The SSH key format used is incorrect/unsupported 
- The private key wasn't correctly loaded with `ssh-add`, may need to use the `-i` parameter
- New or updated keys not taking effect for already created resources
- Incorrect SSH key permission settings

Use the `ssh -vv` command for detailed information.
### Logging in via Password

Copy the SSH login command from the [My Instances]()  page to a terminal or SSH tool and log in using the password provided on the page.
